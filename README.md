# igsm-face-recognition

Goals:
Be able to pull pictures from Kevin Ding's photo face recognition database and verify face recognitions

Requirements:
- Display a set of pictures that need to be verified
- Have an option to confirm or correct how correct the face is
- If the wrong face is given, render a text field that sends to the database to update that face with the correct name
- Have an option to dismiss the picture if it is not of a face
- Eventually deal with duplicate names (just use nickname in database?)
